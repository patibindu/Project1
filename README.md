## Project 1: Housing Market

### Names: Juhi, Kesha, Austin, Hima, and Lora

## Tasks:

1. Maintaining the READ.me and GitHub - Austin

2. Cleaning House price vs. mortgage rate csv and creating data frame - Austin

3. Cleaning Market factors csv and creating data frame - Austin

4. Developing visualizations:

            1. House price vs. mortgage rate scatter plot, r value, linear regression line -Juhi

            Market factors: x-axis: time, y-axis: market factor (impose 2 graphs on each other)

            2. Real disposable income, unemployment line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly) - Lora

            3. House price index, Mortgage rate line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly) - Hima

            4. Inflation, Mortgage rate line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly) - Kesha

            5. Unemployment rate, House price index line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly) - Austin

            6. Population, House price line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly) - Austin

5. Slides on Google Presentation - each person makes their own slide based on what they coded

6. Graphic design on Google Presentation (make cohesive)- Lora

7. Practice Presentation - everyone

## Datasets:

1. Market factors

Monthly_Macroeconomic_Factors.csv

Annual_Macroeconomic_Factors.csv

2. House price vs. mortgage rate

US House Price and Mortgage Rate.csv

## Questions:

1. Is there a correlation between house price and mortgage rate?

Methods: create a scatter plot, calculate the r value, develop a linear regression line

Dataset: House price vs. mortgage rate

2. How are the following macroeconomic factors associated with each other? Unemployment rate, real disposable income, house price index, mortgage rate, inflation, population 

Method: Plot on a line graph the following macroeconomic factors and look at the graphs and make conclusions

Dataset: Market factors
